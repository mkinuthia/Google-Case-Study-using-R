This is the case study project for my Google Data Analytics Certificate which is on my Kaggle page.

In this study, I analyzed fitness data to show how physical activity, sleep and stress affect one's health and wellbeing.Based on my findings, I was then able to make 
recommendations that would guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
